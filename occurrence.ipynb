The convention includes a source citation in an accepted format (e.g. MLA format), which provides evidence of the exact reference to the given entity. While this convention has been in place for a number of centuries, there has been no attempt to make this process comprehensive in any way, and most publications only cite the first, latest, or most relevant source on the subject. While this limited approach has been sufficient for human scholarship in the sciences, it does not go far enough to enable automated methods for entity detection in machine learning. This is primarily due to the ambiguity in named entities, as well as the alternative spellings of such entities, as published in the different languages around the world.\n","The result of this work will add valuable linked data for machine learning. Once these entities are properly cited, we can include each reference in Linked Data (e.g. Wikidata).\n","\n","The following workflow establishes a comprehensive method for detecting and disambiguating named entities in a collection of publications, beginning with a batch of 20k. Each occurrence of an entity is counted and given a page number for formal citation purposes. Additional contextualizing methods will be included at a later stage to address any ambiguity in the resulting occurrences of entities.\n","\n","##Workflow:\n","* Dataset: The first batch included 20k documents. \n","* Data Dictionary: 600 Geographic names (GN), both modern and ancient names for each site.\n","\n","1. Count the ‘occurrences’ of the GNs in the dataset. (this was done by Circle in GSoC 2022)\n","2. Collect the occurrences into a DataFrame for each GN \n","3. Obtain page numbers for each occurrence\n","4. Make an equivalency to the actual page numbers of the document\n","5. Provide the bibliographic data for each document\n","6. Format with Wikidata properties and item IDs\n","7. Export dataset to Zenodo (CSV, json-ld, BibTex)\n","8. Export dataset to Wikidata using QuickStatements (CSV)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"EMBilW1sd55W"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"r3WJaUtAtG1X","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680098630230,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":28531,"user":{"displayName":"Keil Schrifter","userId":"17583169399684700797"}},"outputId":"949e0524-db8e-471a-f00c-33e580a60dc9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting geojson\n","  Downloading geojson-3.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (15 kB)\n","Installing collected packages: geojson\n","Successfully installed geojson-3.0.1\n","Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","\u001b[31mERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement shapely.constructive (from versions: none)\u001b[0m\u001b[31m\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[31mERROR: No matching distribution found for shapely.constructive\u001b[0m\u001b[31m\n","\u001b[0mLooking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting geopandas\n","  Downloading geopandas-0.12.2-py3-none-any.whl (1.1 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.1/1.1 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m13.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hCollecting pyproj>=2.6.1.post1\n","  Downloading pyproj-3.5.0-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (7.8 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m7.8/7.8 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m46.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: shapely>=1.7 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from geopandas) (2.0.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: packaging in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from geopandas) (23.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas>=1.0.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from geopandas) (1.4.4)\n","Collecting fiona>=1.8\n","  Downloading Fiona-1.9.2-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (16.1 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m16.1/16.1 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m45.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: importlib-metadata in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from fiona>=1.8->geopandas) (6.1.0)\n","Collecting click-plugins>=1.0\n","  Downloading click_plugins-1.1.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl (7.5 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: attrs>=19.2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from fiona>=1.8->geopandas) (22.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: click~=8.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from fiona>=1.8->geopandas) (8.1.3)\n","Collecting cligj>=0.5\n","  Downloading cligj-0.7.2-py3-none-any.whl (7.1 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from fiona>=1.8->geopandas) (2022.12.7)\n","Collecting munch>=2.3.2\n","  Downloading munch-2.5.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl (10 kB)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2020.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from pandas>=1.0.0->geopandas) (2022.7.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.8.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from pandas>=1.0.0->geopandas) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.18.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from pandas>=1.0.0->geopandas) (1.22.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from munch>=2.3.2->fiona>=1.8->geopandas) (1.16.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: zipp>=0.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from importlib-metadata->fiona>=1.8->geopandas) (3.15.0)\n","Installing collected packages: pyproj, munch, cligj, click-plugins, fiona, geopandas\n","Successfully installed click-plugins-1.1.1 cligj-0.7.2 fiona-1.9.2 geopandas-0.12.2 munch-2.5.0 pyproj-3.5.0\n"]}],"source":["!pip3 install geojson\n","!pip3 install shapely.constructive\n","!pip install geopandas\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import csv \n","import plotly.express as px\n","import geopandas as gpd\n","import json\n","import requests\n","%matplotlib inline\n","from shapely.geometry import Point\n","from geopandas import datasets, GeoDataFrame, read_file"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","#workdir = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Sumerian Network' #
